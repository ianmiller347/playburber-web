        <h3>Stairway from the bottom to the top</h3>
        <p>
          This one is pretty cool. They said I&apos;d never make it to the top,
          because I come from the bottom. But if you start at the bedrock and
          you can&apos;t go down. You can go all the way up till you can&apos;t
          build no mo. It&apos;s quite exciting to see, and along the way there
          are trees ðŸ˜Š

        <h3>Auto smelter</h3>
        <p>
          So when you are at the community base and you want to check out what
          our villagers are doing, you might wonder where is the smithy man.
          Well let me tell you, he is smelting away at the outpost. It is
          automagic and wonderful how delightful this can be.

        <h3>Dark red tower</h3>
        <p>
          It is a little bit spooky but also a little bit charming. It is tall.
          Over there, across the way! It&apos;s the dark tower?! You don&apos;t
          say!
